        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Optional: black pepper</li>
        <li>Optional: butter</li>
        <li>Optional: garlic cloves, peeled and smashed</li>
        <li>Optional: any fresh herbs (like thyme or rosemary)</li>
        <li>Optional: lemon slices</li>
        <li>Optional: vegetables (broccoli, asparagus, carrots...)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 180 C.</li>
        <li>Generously season salmon with salt (and black pepper, if using) on each side.</li>
        <li>Get a piece of tin foil, large enough to place the salmon and fold over it.</li>
        <li>Place the tin foil on a baking sheet, partially hanging out 
            and pour a bit of oil on the part that's on the baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Place salmon on the oiled foil top-side down, then turn it over on the bottom side
            (this way both sides are thinly covered in oil).
        </li>
        <li>If using garlic, place a clove on the highest point of each salmon filet.</li>
        <li>If using butter, place a small knob on top of the garlic.</li>
        <li>If using fresh herbs, place a sprig on top or the side of the salmon filets</li>
        <li>If using lemon slices, place one on top of each salmon filet.</li>
        <li>If using vegetables, chop them up and place around the salmon filets, making sure you have
            1-2cm of free tin foil left on each side.
        </li>
        <li>Fold the remaining tin foil over the salmon and then fold all the edges together to create a sealed pocket.</li>
        <li>Place in the oven and bake for 15-30min depending on the size of your filets. 
            (15 for single portion filets, 30 for half a fish)</li>
    </ol>
