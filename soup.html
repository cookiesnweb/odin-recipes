    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Choose your ingredients, in any combination, from each category.</li>
        <li>Chop all the vegetables in big chunks, enough of them to fill around 1/2 of the pot you want to use.</li>
        <li>Heat up enough oil to cover the bottom of your pot.</li>
        <li>If using onions and garlic, toss them in the oil and cook until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add all your chopped vegetables and season generously with salt, pepper and any other spices you may be using.</li>
        <li>Mix well, so the vegetables are covered with everything else in the pot.</li>
        <li>Pour enough water to cover your vegetables and throw in the bay leaves and fresh herbs, if using.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot and turn the heat up until the water starts simmering; then turn the heat down to keep the simmer.</li>
        <li>Now walk away for 20 min.</li>
        <li>Check if the vegetables are cooked by cutting one in half - it should be easy to do so even with a spoon.</li>
        <li>Turn the stove off and take the bay leaves and herb sprigs out.</li>
        <li>Pur√©e the soup with a stab mixer until smooth. 
            If using milk or heavy cream, add it now and then mix some more until incorporated.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust seasoning.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Prepare optional toppings:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Croutons: cut the bread slices into cubes, toss with a bit of oil. Bake at 160 C for 15 min.</li>
        <li>Bacon/sausage bits: cook in a pan until browned on all sides.</li>
        <li>Seeds or nuts: toast in a pan until fragrant or bake at 160 C for 15 min.</li>
        <li>Herbs: chop finely and sprinkle in each bowl.</li>
        <li>Dairy: add about a spoonful of grated/crumbled cheese or sour cream in each bowl.</li>
    </ul>
